/**
	The linear resampler implements linear interpolation resampling.
	Linear interpolation prevents nasty harmonics being added to the sound during
	resampling. Technically, linear interpolation is not very good - but sound
	quality is a very subjective thing, and this resampler certainly has a low end
	"kick" that the FIR resampler certainly lacks(probably cause it ain't supposed to
	be there :) As as extra bonus, it's pretty fast!
