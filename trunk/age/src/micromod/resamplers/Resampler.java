/**
	The Resampler interface specifies a pure resampling algorithm.
	The algorithm need not maintain any state between invocations,
	making implementations of resamplers far more straight-forward.
	As an added advantage, the resampling loop (where most of the
	cpu time is spent) can be made tighter. Since an implementation
	need not have to maintain a state, a single instance of a Resampler
	can be used for all channels, and this may be switched on the fly.
