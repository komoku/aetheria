# Aetheria Game Engine

Aetheria Game Engine is a system for playing text adventure (interactive fiction) games, written in Java. Game worlds are represented in XML, with Beanshell code to account for complex object behaviour. PUCK (Playable Universe Construction Kit) is a graphical IDE that can be used to build such XML files.

The system was originally Spanish only and tailored for Spanish games, but multi-language support is now implemented and the system has been translated into English, as well as Galician, Catalan and Esperanto.

If you are a speaker of a different language and you would like to help translate the system to support games in your language, please contact me. Almost no programming is needed to do a translation, and I can help with that.

This project started in 2000, uploaded to Google Code in 2010, migrated to GitHub in 2015.
